# Brain Tumor MRI Detection

According to the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS), an estimated **1 million Americans** are currently living with a primary brain tumor. In 2023, brain tumors were the **10th leading cause of death** among both males and females, with an estimated **18,990 deaths** reported.

As machine learning continues to expand its role in healthcare, the demand for **accurate** and **ethically developed** AI models is more critical than ever. This project focuses on the automatic detection and classification of three primary types of brain tumors using MRI scans:

- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary Tumors**

By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to support early diagnosis and enhance clinical decision-making in neuro-oncology.
